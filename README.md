# recycling bin detection
To segment and recognize object, itâ€™s important to classify each pixel into different colors, segment image into regions and detect target object based on geometry shape. In this project, we have developed a logistic regression model to classify pixel into R, G, B, three spaces and provided a solution to detect recycling bin based on logistic regression and image region shape from training data.
